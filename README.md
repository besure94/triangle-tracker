## Triangle Tracker

#### By Brian Scherner

#### An application used to determine three types of triangles.

## Description

This application allows users to input the lengths for three sides of a triangle. If all sides are equal, the result will be an equilateral triangle. If two sides are equal, the result will be an isosceles triangle. If all sides are different, the result will be a scalene triangle. If the sum of two sides is less than or equal to the third side, the result will not be a triangle.

## Technologies Used

* CSS

## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Known Bugs

Application is functioning correctly, but lacks styling. When time allows I plan to add more CSS to the application to make it look more visually appealing.
